Project description:
The aim of the app was to build a safe space where people could share their light hearted reflections on the unique circumstances of the pandemic. We wanted people to fill in a form to share their memories, including details of the memory and a picture/location if they wanted to, and for this to appear on the screen in a message board style. We used a panda to represent a cute mascot for the site and as a play on words of the pandemic.

User stories and problem domain:
As a user, I am eager to share my unique pandemic experience on the website, hoping to contribute to the collective narrative. I look forward to accessing all the available tools on the web page to effortlessly post my personal story. Additionally, I am excited about the opportunity to explore and read the diverse range of stories shared by previous users, which I understand are stored in the website's database. This not only allows me to engage with the community but also provides a platform for me to reflect on the shared experiences of others during this significant period. Overall, I anticipate a meaningful and interactive experience on the website, connecting with a broader community through the stories we've all lived through.
